# Overview
This section of testing involves collating a list of sites as to map out our attack surface. In a penetration test with a predefined tight application scope with specific subdomains and URLs, it may be necessary to skip this step. Sites include domains, subdomains, and virtual hosts. They can be identified using passive reconnaissance, DNS enumeration, and virtual host fuzzing.
# Subdomain Enumeration
```shell-session
subfinder -d inlanefreight.com -v       
```
