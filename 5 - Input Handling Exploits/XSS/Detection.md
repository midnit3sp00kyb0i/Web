1. Check if **any value you control** (_parameters_, _path_, _headers_?, _cookies_?) is being **reflected** in the HTML or **used** by **JS** code.
2. **Find the context** where it’s reflected/used.
3. If **reflected**
    1. Check **which symbols can you use** and depending on that, prepare the payload:
        1. In **raw HTML**:
            1. Can you create new HTML tags?
            2. Can you use events or attributes supporting `javascript:` protocol?
            3. Can you bypass protections?
            4. Is the HTML content being interpreted by any client side JS engine (_AngularJS_, _VueJS_, _Mavo_…), you could abuse a [**Client Side Template Injection**](https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/pentesting-web/client-side-template-injection-csti.html).
            5. If you cannot create HTML tags that execute JS code, could you abuse a [**Dangling Markup - HTML scriptless injection**](https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/pentesting-web/dangling-markup-html-scriptless-injection/index.html)?
        2. Inside a **HTML tag**:
            1. Can you exit to raw HTML context?
            2. Can you create new events/attributes to execute JS code?
            3. Does the attribute where you are trapped support JS execution?
            4. Can you bypass protections?
        3. Inside **JavaScript code**:
            1. Can you escape the `<script>` tag?
            2. Can you escape the string and execute different JS code?
            3. Are your input in template literals ``?
            4. Can you bypass protections?
        4. JavaScript **function** being **executed**
            1. You can indicate the name of the function to execute. e.g.: `?callback=alert(1)`
4. If **used**:
    1. You could exploit a **DOM XSS**, pay attention how your input is controlled and if your **controlled input is used by any sink.**

# Automation
## Crawling
To have XSSStrike crawl and automatically identify parameters, give the base path and the `--crawl` option:
```
./xssstrike.py  
```
